 jeni: dependency aggregation (dip)
====================================

**jeni** lets you build applications and not e.g. web applications.

Overview
========

1. Define a set of dependencies that your system uses.
2. Give your code natural call interfaces accepting those dependencies.
3. Implement a **Provider** which can fulfill those dependencies in one call.

This is **dependency aggregation**. Gather your dependencies into namespaces,
use those namespaces to annotate callables, then implement those namespaces for
the various contexts in which your application will need to run.

jeni runs on Python 2.7, Python 3.2, Python 3.3, and pypy.


Motivation
==========

Write code as its meant to be written, without pegging your call signatures to
some monolithic object that only applies to a specific runtime. This is about
more than just testing. This lets you write composable utilities.

jeni's design principle is to have all annotated callables usable in a context
that knows nothing about jeni. Any callable is as relevant to a fresh Python
REPL as it is to a Provider.


Annotations
===========

Annotations are implemented as decorators and not Python3 annotations in order
to support Python2 and to allow for callables to have multiple annotations.


API
===

.. exec:: import jeni
.. eval:: insert_doc(jeni.BaseProvider)


.. eval:: insert_args_doc(jeni.BaseProvider.annotate, ns='BaseProvider')


.. eval:: insert_args_doc(jeni.BaseProvider.apply, ns='BaseProvider')


.. eval:: insert_args_doc(jeni.BaseProvider.partial, ns='BaseProvider')


.. eval:: insert_args_doc(jeni.BaseProvider.close, ns='BaseProvider')


.. eval:: insert_args_doc(jeni.BaseProvider.implement, ns='BaseProvider')


.. eval:: insert_args_doc(jeni.BaseProvider.extend, ns='BaseProvider')
